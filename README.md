# ClipProcessor

**ClipProcessor** is a Python-based tool for downloading and processing media clips (audio and video) from online sources. It uses `yt-dlp` for downloading media and `FFmpeg` for cutting and converting clips, enabling batch processing for multiple clips.

## Features
- **Audio and Video Downloading**: Download media from various sources using `yt-dlp`, supporting the best available audio or video formats.
- **Clip Cutting**: Specify start and end times to extract specific parts of the audio or video.
- **MP3 Conversion**: Converts audio clips into MP3 format with customizable bitrate settings.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple media clips at once from a configuration file.
- **Disk Space Monitoring**: Displays disk space usage before and after processing, ensuring efficient management of storage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `yt-dlp` (for downloading media)
- `FFmpeg` (for media processing)
- Sufficient disk space for storing the processed clips

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ClipProcessor.git
   cd ClipProcessor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Install `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg` if you don't have them already:
   
   - For `yt-dlp`:
     ```bash
     pip install yt-dlp
     ```

   - For `FFmpeg`:
     - **Windows**: Download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your PATH.
     - **macOS/Linux**: Use package managers (e.g., `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS or `sudo apt install ffmpeg` on Ubuntu).

## Configuration

1. **Create a configuration file (`clips_config.txt`)**:
   The configuration file should contain each clipâ€™s URL, start time, end time, and output filename, separated by commas. For example:
   ```txt
   https://example.com/video1,00:00:30,00:01:00,clip1.mp3
   https://example.com/video2,00:01:15,00:02:00,clip2.mp3
   ```
   - If you want to skip clipping for certain clips, use a dash (`-`) for the start or end time, e.g.,
     ```txt
     -,00:01:30,clip3.mp3
     ```

2. **Output Directory**:
   The processed clips will be saved in the `output_dir` specified in the script. By default, it is set to `C:\\Users\\anass\\Desktop\\clips`.

## Usage

To run the script:

1. Place the `clips_config.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python clipprocessor.py
   ```
   The script will process each entry in the configuration file, download the media, and save the processed clips to the output directory.

## Disk Space Monitoring

Before and after processing the clips, the script will print the available disk space in the output directory. This ensures you have enough space for the processed clips.

## Example Output
```
Disk space before processing: 10 GiB free
Processing: https://example.com/video1 -> clip1.mp3
Processing https://example.com/video1...
Output file path: C:\Users\anass\Desktop\clips\clip1.mp3
Processed audio saved to C:\Users\anass\Desktop\clips\clip1.mp3.
Disk space after processing: 9 GiB free
Batch processing completed.
```
